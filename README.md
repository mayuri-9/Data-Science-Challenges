# Data-Science-Challenges
Solutions to different data science and machine learning competitions that I've participated in. Exploratory data analysis and predictions for various different real-world problems.

## 1. [Predict Lap Timings for Qualifying Session of a Formula E Race](https://github.com/mayuri-9/Data-Science-Challenges/blob/main/LapTimePrediction.ipynb)

Considering several factors that affects a driver's performance including weather and track conditions we have to build a machine learning model that predicts the drivers' lap time for the qualifying session rounds.

## 2. Data Analysis and Visualization on Food Delivery

Performing exploratory data analysis and visualization on data from a food delivery app that contains features based on different restaurants. The aim is to explore the data and gain meaningful insights. The data can be found [here.](https://machinehack.com/hackathon/visualization/visualization_challenge_1_analyze_and_visualize_the_food_delivery_time_for_different_cuisines/overview)
