# Data-Science-Challenges
Solutions to different data science and machine learning competitions that I've participated in. Exploratory data analysis and predictions for various different real-world problems.

## 1. [Predict Lap Timings for Qualifying Session of a Formula E Race](https://github.com/mayuri-9/Data-Science-Challenges/blob/main/LapTimePrediction.ipynb)

Considering several factors that affects a driver's performance including weather and track conditions we have to build a machine learning model that predicts the drivers' lap time for the qualifying session rounds.
